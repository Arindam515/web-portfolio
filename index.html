        <h2> Big Dream</h2>
        <h3> Become a <span class="color"> Software Engineer </span></h3>
        <p> My dream job is to become a successful software engineer because I have always been into computer systems, but can I fit this job, is the career life something I can manage and what opportunities should I go after when becoming a software engineer. Each time I notice how a program is used I wonder how can I make it become faster or more efficient. When you are using your cell phone or iPad there is usually an update at every month. This is because apple is improving the speed of your applications. A software engineer is sometimes overlooked, but without software engineer’s applications would either crash or would not improve.</p>
